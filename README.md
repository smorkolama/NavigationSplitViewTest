#  Test project for NavigationSplitView

The purpose of this project is to get more familiar with `NavigationSplitView` in SwiftUI.

Features:

- Both 2 and 3 column layouts are available.
- Project should work both on iPhone and iPad.
- Optional behaviour (enabled by default, see `autoSelectFirstItemOnPad`) to auto select the first `Item` on iPad because to me this looks a bit better.
- Swipe to delete and Edit mode are supported.
